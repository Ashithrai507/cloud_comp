an intro to cloud computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and AI) over the internet (“the cloud”) instead of running them on your own physical computer or data center.

You pay only for what you use (like electricity or water).
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Provides virtual machines, storage, networking.

Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs.

 You manage OS, apps; provider manages hardware.

PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Provides platform + runtime environment to build apps without worrying about infrastructure.

Example: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

 You focus only on application code.

SaaS (Software as a Service)

Ready-to-use software applications delivered via internet.

Example: Gmail, Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

 Just use the software, provider manages everything.
