an intro to cloud computing
# ☁️ Cloud Computing

##  Definition
Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services** (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and AI) **over the internet (“the cloud”)** instead of running them on your own physical computer or data center.  

You **pay only for what you use** (like electricity or water).

## Characteristics
- ⚡ **On-demand self-service** – Get resources whenever you need.  
- 🌍 **Broad network access** – Access from anywhere via the internet.  
- 🏗 **Resource pooling** – Shared infrastructure for multiple users.  
- 📈 **Scalability & elasticity** – Scale resources up or down instantly.  
- 💰 **Pay-as-you-go pricing** – Pay only for what you consume.

##  Types of Cloud Services (Service Models)
### 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides **virtual machines, storage, networking**  
- Examples: **AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs**  
- 💡 You manage OS & apps, provider manages hardware  

### 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Provides **platform + runtime environment** for building apps  
- Examples: **Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
- 💡 You focus only on your application code  

### 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Ready-to-use **applications delivered via the internet**  
- Examples: **Gmail, Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Salesforce**  
- 💡 Just use the software, provider manages everything

##  Cloud Deployment Models
- 🌐 **Public Cloud** – Services available to everyone (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- 🏢 **Private Cloud** – Dedicated cloud for one organization  
- 🔀 **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of public + private  
- ☁️☁️ **Multi-Cloud** – Using multiple providers for flexibility  

---

## 🔹 Benefits
- ✅ Cost savings – no need to buy servers  
- ✅ Scalability & flexibility  
- ✅ Global accessibility  
- ✅ Reliability & disaster recovery  
- ✅ Focus on business, not infrastructure

## 🔹 Real-life Examples
- 🎬 **Netflix** – Uses AWS for global video streaming  
- 📂 **Google Drive** – Store & access files anywhere  
- 🎥 **Zoom** – Runs video conferencing on the cloud

## 📌 In short
**Cloud computing = renting IT resources on-demand over the internet instead of owning them.**
