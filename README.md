an intro to cloud computing
# ☁️ Cloud Computing

##  Definition
Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services** (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and AI) **over the internet (“the cloud”)** instead of running them on your own physical computer or data center.  

You **pay only for what you use** (like electricity or water).  

---

## Characteristics
-  **On-demand self-service** – Get resources whenever you need.  
-  **Broad network access** – Access from anywhere via the internet.  
-  **Resource pooling** – Shared infrastructure for multiple users.  
-  **Scalability & elasticity** – Scale resources up or down instantly.  
-  **Pay-as-you-go pricing** – Pay only for what you consume.

##  Types of Cloud Services (Service Models)
### 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides **virtual machines, storage, networking**  
- Examples: **AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs**  
-  You manage OS & apps, provider manages hardware  

### 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Provides **platform + runtime environment** for building apps  
- Examples: **Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
-  You focus only on your application code  

### 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Ready-to-use **applications delivered via the internet**  
- Examples: **Gmail, Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Salesforce**  
-  Just use the software, provider manages everything

##  Cloud Deployment Models
-  **Public Cloud** – Services available to everyone (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
-  **Private Cloud** – Dedicated cloud for one organization  
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of public + private  
-  **Multi-Cloud** – Using multiple providers for flexibility  

---

##  Benefits
- Cost savings – no need to buy servers  
-  Scalability & flexibility  
-  Global accessibility  
-  Reliability & disaster recovery  
-  Focus on business, not infrastructure  

---

##  Real-life Examples
-  **Netflix** – Uses AWS for global video streaming  
-  **Google Drive** – Store & access files anywhere  
-  **Zoom** – Runs video conferencing on the cloud  

---

##  In short
**Cloud computing = renting IT resources on-demand over the internet instead of owning them.**
